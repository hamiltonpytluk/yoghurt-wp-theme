				<h2>is Aussie yoghurt actually Greek yogurt in disguise?</h2>
				<p>No, mate! Greek yogurt is strained, which gives it that famously dense texture and tangy taste. The Aussie recipe we use doesn’t call for any straining. Combine our “let-it-be” technique with our whole milk, and the result is an ideal balance between creaminess and richness that’s pure yum.</p>

				<h2>do you make your yoghurt in Australia?</h2>
				<p>Noosa has always been made right here in the US of A, and yes it was started by true blue Australians. We love working directly with local American farmers and their happy cows. It’s the only way we can be sure that we’re using the freshest, best milk around. Our recipe is from Oz, but that yoghurt you’re holding isn’t.</p>

				<h2>why’s the fruit all bunched up in a corner?</h2>
				<p>We like to do things the Aussie way, and a big part of that is never blending our fruit purées with our yoghurt. We love spooning it up however it comes in the tub. Some bites will be tart, some will be sweet, and all will be delicious.</p>

				<h2>what’s the “h” in yoghurt for?</h2>
				<p>Yoghurt with an “h” is the preferred Aussie spelling. The “h” stands for “Holy dooley! That’s yum!”</p>
