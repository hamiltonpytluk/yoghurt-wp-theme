		<p class="slide-text">It’s simple: farm-fresh yoghurt demands farm-fresh milk. The dairies we work with are all located close to Noosa HQ in northern Colorado. That means we get top-notch milk from our own neck of the woods. Curious about our stance on happy cows? Click here to learn more.</p>

		<p class="between-text">Bellvue’s Morning Fresh Dairy has been a member of the Noosa fam since the beginning. (They were our very first dairy partner!) We’re proud to call this farm home, and thrilled to still make our yoghurt right next door to some of our favorite cows.</p>

		<p class="slide-text">A little something sweet is always a good thing—especially when it comes to our yoghurt. Every batch of Noosa (except tart Plain Noosa, of course), is infused with a touch of local honey for a completely unique, totally bonza taste.</p>

		<p class="between-text">One of the best things about Colorado? You don’t have to go far to pick up ace ingredients. Founded in 1908, Beeyond The Hive is one of the oldest honey companies in the state and another of our first partners. We still add their clover alfalfa honey to flavored Noosa.</p>

		<h2 class="slide-header">Our Fruit</h2>
		<p class="slide-text">Once upon a time we used to make all our fruit purées by hand in the Morning Fresh Dairy family kitchen. We don’t do that anymore (it’s a lot of work, mate), but we’re still obsessed with using fresh, real fruit and keeping our purées natural with plenty of juicy pieces.</p>

				<h4 class="ingredients-header">Why do you always use whole milk?</h4>
				<p class="ingredients-paragraph">Whole milk isn’t bad—we’ve always loved it! Not only is our grade A whole milk heaps more delicious than the skim stuff you might be used to, it also keeps you (and your tummy) feeling more satisfied and happier longer. Plus, it’s got the protein and calcium on-the-go lifestyles demand. Whoever said eating well was the same thing as eating boring?</p>

				<h4 class="ingredients-header">If you mix your yoghurt with honey, why do you need the added cane sugar?</h4>
				<p class="ingredients-paragraph">One thing we learned early on in the yoghurt-making process is that it’s an imperfect science. We want every single spoonful of Noosa to taste as good as the last, and to do that we use cane sugar. It helps tone down the natural honey flavor, while ensuring every bite has the absolute perfect amount of sweetness (never too much, never too little).</p>

				<h4 class="ingredients-header">Why do you need stabilizers?</h4>
				<p class="ingredients-paragraph">It takes a lot of work to get the luscious texture our Aussie yoghurt is famous for just right. That’s where gelatin and pectin come in. We use kosher, bovine gelatin and fruit-derived pectin to make sure each batch sets up perfectly, and you know what to expect when you pop the lid. Unfortunately, we realize that the gelatin we use may make Noosa unacceptable for vegetarians and vegans—sorry, mates.</p>
