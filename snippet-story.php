				<h3>good things come in yoghurt-shaped packages</h3>
				<p>When our Aussie co-founder, Koel, was visiting her fam in Oz, she came across a simple tub filled with yoghurt and passion fruit purée. One bite and she was hooked. The only problem? She’d moved to the states a few years before.</p>

				<h3>getting the yoghurt to the US</h3>
				<p>The yoghurt was too good to stay Down Under forever. But how to get it to America? A bit of mum-assisted sleuthing revealed that the fam behind the yum lived in the nearby town of Noosa. Koel invited them to lunch and before the check was paid they had an agreement.</p>

				<h3>doing anything for yum</h3>
				<p>Once Koel was settled back in Colorado, Grant and Paul (grandsons of the nice lady who came up with the brilliant recipe) flew over to help make sure the American version of their family yoghurt was coming along nicely.</p>

				<h3>the sweet taste of success</h3>
				<p>No long after her return, Koel met Rob, the owner of a family dairy in Bellvue. They were instant mates, and Rob agreed to let her set up shop on the farm. The small team sold (out of) the first batches at local farmers markets. A few years later, Noosa was available nationwide.</p>
